NAME OF THE PROJECT: Gravity

DESCRIPTION: web application created using JavaScript, Python, and SQL, based in part on the web trackâ€™s distribution code of the CS50 course.
The purpose of this web application is to allow users to convert a given weight from Earth into weight on other worlds of the Solar System, such as on the Moon or Mars.
For using the calculator it is necessary to register/login. When registering, the user's info is stored in a database.
Additionally, the application allows users to check the history of calculations, because they were stored in the database as well.
